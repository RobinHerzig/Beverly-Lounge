# Coding Challenges

https://www.codewars.com

Codewars is a website that provides challenges (Kata) for developers. Successful submissions, those that solve the challenge, award points to the user. The number of points a user has determines their rank, or kyu.

## How It's Made:

This repository contains solutions to all the Kata that I attempt. Each file includes the challenge, solution, and my pseudocode.

I solve at least 5 Codewars a week.

## Optimizations:

If you give a kata to 100 engineers, you'll get 100 different solutions. This makes Codewars an excellent resource to discover new ways of solving problems.

No one solution is the best, so it's important to consider all options. Then weigh them for readability, efficiency, and consider the needs of the team.

## Lessons Learned:

There's always something new to learn! When I come across an unexpected solution, I add it to my daily study bank. Learning new techniques and methods helps me grow as a developer.
